1/4 cup all-purpose flour (the bran in whole wheat tends to stick to the bottom of the pan and doesn't incorporate well into the final product)
1/4 cup butter or other fat
~20 ounces broth/stock

1. Make roux with flour and fat to desired browning
2. Add broth a little at a time to prevent clumping
3. Add broth until desired consistency is achieved
