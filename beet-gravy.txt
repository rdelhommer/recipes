Notes
* In general, I'm very imprecise with my amounts as I tend to eyeball everything.
* You can substitute an additional tomato for the red wine if you don't have any.  Additionally, red wine can be substituted for tomato if you dont have any tomato
* Any stock can be used.  I just happened to have some celery stock around that was about to go bad.
* Spice amounts are pretty approximate.  I'm confident in the amount of Allspice, but the amount of paprika could be off...
* Celery seeds were added to enhance the flavor of the stock, and could probably be left out in a future incarnation that doesn't use celery stock.
* I haven't tried this yet, but I think parmesan cheese would go really well with this dish.
* I also think this could make a really good base for an Indian style beet curry if you add the right spices.

    3 Tomatoes small (large cubed)
    1 Onion (diced)
    4 Garlic cloves (diced/sliced/whatever)

    4) Add garlic when onion is finished carmelizing
    5) Add tomato, stock, beets, spices, and wine when garlic is finished
